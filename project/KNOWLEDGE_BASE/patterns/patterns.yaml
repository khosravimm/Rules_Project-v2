    notes: >
      This is a validated 4h L2 sequence pattern derived from mapped 5m
      micro-structure. When three consecutive 4h candles close UP with
      sufficiently strong bodies and limited upper wicks under moderate
      volatility, the next 4h candle shows an UP direction with lift
      significantly above baseline. This rule is approved by the project
      owner and should be stored as a strong pattern in the KB.
